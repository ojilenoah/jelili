## Core Features:

- Gamified Entry Gate: Require the correct answer ('ebelebo') to a prompt before granting access to the site.
- Interactive Love Note Display: Show a poetic text inside a large featured card styled as a 'game quest card' with frosted-glass texture, glow edges, and 3D effect.
- Icon-Based Interaction System: Scatter stationary themed icons that trigger note cards to open. Include smooth animations and a blurring effect.
- Note Cards Display: Display note cards with different muted aesthetic colors and frosted-glass styling upon icon click.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#8B0000) to reflect the theme of love and intensity, providing a rich contrast against the light background.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5FFFA), a desaturated mint-green, for a frosted-glass effect that complements the red accents, evoking cleanliness and subtle sophistication.
- Accent color: Light pastel green (#98FF98), a softer contrast to create highlights and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a minimalist, 2D game-inspired interface. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for the card content. 
- Use custom, elegant, themed icons such as fruit, crown, flame, music note, heart outline, chat bubble and infinity symbol.
- Minimalist structure with three pages and a floating footer containing three navigation buttons. The featured card should be centered on the main page.
- Smooth micro-animations for buttons, subtle pulse and jitter animations for icons, and soft pop/flip animations for card transitions to provide a smooth game-like user experience.
